The scenario has been automated such that two employees will be created and verified. The current issue is not being able to identify the [@class="text-base font-bold"] elements on my runs. This is the last step of the scenario where an array should be retrieved and asserted for the two employee names created. Multiple locators(which work fine in the DOM) have been used but to no avail.
